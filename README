// DESCRIPTION:

Artsmesh unifies and simplifies the process of conducting tele-performance for musicians.
Artsmesh has the client-side application runs on Mac OS X 10.6, and the Ruby on Rails REST 
web service. The client-side application of Artsmesh runs on users' Mac OS X system. The
REST web service runs on the Syneme server for coordinating and exchanging users/clients 
information including: Name, IP addressess, ports, parameters, relationship, etc.



// FUNCTIONS:

Automatically launch and terminate Jack Server.
1, Automatically launch JackTrip as server and client, and automatically establish JackTrip 
connections among Artsmesh users in the Cartesian way.



// PREREQUISITE:

Softwares must be installed before using Artsmesh client.
1, Jack Server for Mac OS X 10.5 or 10.6
2, JackTrip >= 1.0.4 (For IPv6 environment, a version support IPv6 needed. )
3, iChat



// BEFORE START USING ARTSMESH CLIENT:

1, The Artsmesh REST web service needs to be running well.
2, If the iChat is not running, it can be started by clicking the "Start ichat" toolbar item 
in Artsmesh.

3, New and integrated Jack Routing Pane UI
